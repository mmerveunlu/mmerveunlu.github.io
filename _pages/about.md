I work as a research/teaching assistant in the Computer Engineering Deptartment of Galatasaray University. I assist undergraduate students in their practical sessions for Algorithms and Advanced Programming, Parallel Programming and Introduction to Computer Engineering.  

After completing Bachelor degree from Galatasaray University, in Computer Engineering, I obtained M.S. degree in 2014 from the Computer Science Department, Ecole-Normale Superieur de Lyon, working on parallisation using MPI of a simulation developed by Beagle team. 

I received my second M.S. degree in 2019 from the Computer Engineering Department, Bogazici University working on a question answering system with deep learning methods on spoken documents while being  advised by Ebru Arısoy Saraçlar and Arzucan Özgür. I still proceed my education as a Ph.D. student at Boğaziçi University, Istanbul, again, I am also happy to be supervised by Ebru Arısoy Saraçlar and Arzucan Özgür for my Ph.D as well. 

My main research interests focus on natural language processing, particularly in spoken question answering. My research explores the approaches to convert the spoken QA task into machine comprehension style QA to improve the accuracy and handle the uncertainty in speech recognition systems.
